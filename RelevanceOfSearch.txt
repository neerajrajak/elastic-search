Relevant Documents in an index are categrorized as :
  - true positives
  - false positives
  - true negatives
  - false negatives


What is Precision?
  What portion of the retrieved data is actually relevant to the search query?

  Precision  = True positives / true positives + false positives

What is Recall?
  What portion of relevant data is being returned as search results

  Precision  = True positives / true positives + false negatives

- Precision and Recall is inversely related
- In precision, all the retrieved results to be a perfect match to the query, even if it means returning less documents
- Recall, retrieve more results even if documents may not be a perfect match to the query

Ranking - referes to ordering of the results (from most relevant at the top to least relevant at the bottom)

What is a Score?
  - The score is a value that represents how relevant a document is to that specific query
  - A score os computed for each document that is a hit

**Term frequency determines how many times each search term appear in a dcoument

**Inverse Document Frequency diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely!
